I. Section 1: Introduction to FPGAs and Xilinx Architectures:
    => In this section, you will get an understanding of:
        what a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) is,
        what the underlying technology is,
        and an introduction to the Artix-7 architecture.

    => This part of the book comprises the following chapter:
        • Chapter 1, Introduction to FPGA Architectures and Xilinx Vivado

    => In this chapter, we are going to cover the following main topics:
        • What is an ASIC?
        • How does a company create an FPGA?
        • What makes up an FPGA?
        • How can we use the Xilinx Vivado tools to design, test, and implement an FPGA?
