1. Introducing FPGAs:
    => In ASICs, a gate array is a "sea of gates" that can be customized with a few mask steps, making it cheaper since only specific masks are needed.
    => FPGAs extend this concept by including programmable interconnects within the device.

    => The core of an FPGA is its programmable fabric, composed of LUTs and flip-flops forming slices and CLBs.
    => These blocks are interconnected by routing channels, enabling flexible configurations.
    => FPGAs also include various additional resources like block RAMs, SERDES cores, DSP elements, and various types of programmable I\O.

2. Storage:

3. Clocking:

4. I/Os:

5. DSP:
    => Digital Signal Processing (DSP) is the use of digital techniques to analyze, modify, and improve signals such as audio, video, and sensor data.
    => It involves mathematical operations to process these signals in a digital format, often to enhance quality, extract information, or transform them for various applications.

    => FPGAs are widely used in Digital Signal Processing applications, particularly those requiring many multipliers and Multiply Accumulate (MAC) functions. => One of the early innovations in FPGAs was the inclusion of hard multipliers and DSP blocks specifically designed to perform MAC functions.

6. ASMBL Architecture:
    => ASMBL refers to Advanced Silicon Modular Block
    => ASMBL architecture uses a modular approach to FPGA design, consisting of various pre-designed blocks that can be configured and combined to build complex digital systems efficiently.
    => This approach offers flexibility, efficient use of resources, and scalability.
