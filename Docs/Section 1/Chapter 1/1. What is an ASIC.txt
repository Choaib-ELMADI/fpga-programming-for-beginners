1. What is an ASIC?
    => ASIC means: Application Specific Integrated Circuit.
    => ASICs are the fundamental building blocks of modern electronics - your laptop, PC...
    => They are also the fundamental building blocks upon which some FPGAs are built from.
    => In short, an ASIC is a custom-built chip designed for some specific purposes and to solve some specific problems.

2. Why Choose ASIC or FPGA?
    => ASICs:
        * "Cost Efficiency in High Volumes": Economical when produced in large quantities (calculators, flash drives, cell phones).
        * "Performance and Complexity": Necessary for high-speed and highly complex logic applications.
        * "Development Costs":
            > High Non-Recurring Engineering (NRE) costs, including mask sets and extensive engineering teams.
            > Re-spins (bug fixes) add to costs due to complexity.
        * "Per Part Cost": Can be very low for simple devices, but high for complex ones.
    
    => FPGAs:
        * "Development Flexibility":
            > Can be developed by small teams or even individuals.
            > NRE costs are minimal as they are mostly borne by the FPGA vendor.
            > Re-spins are free, only costing time for reprogramming.
        * "Per Part Cost": Generally higher than ASICs.
        * "Tool Costs":
            > Development tools like Xilinx Vivado are available for free or at low cost for small-scale use.
            > Professional tools are relatively affordable compared to ASIC tools.
        * "Risk and Training": Lower risk and simpler training compared to ASICs, as mistakes are inexpensive to fix and tools are user-friendly.
