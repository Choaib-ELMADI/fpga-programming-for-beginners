II. Section 2: Introduction to Verilog RTL Design, Simulation, and Implementation:
    => In this section:
        you will learn to program SystemVerilog up to an intermediate level. 
        You will design, test, and implement multiple designs from specification through to implementation on an actual board (if you desire).

    => This part of the book comprises the following chapters:
        • Chapter 2, Combinational Logic 
        • Chapter 3, Counting Button Presses 
        • Chapter 4, Let's Build a Calculator 
        • Chapter 5, FPGA Resources and How to Use Them
        • Chapter 6, Math, Parallelism, and Pipelined Design

    => In chapter 2, we are going to cover the following main topics:
        • Creating SystemVerilog modules
        • Introducing data types
        • Packaging up code using functions
        • Project - creating combinational logic

    => In chapter 3, we are going to cover the following main topics:
        • Learn what sequential elements are and how to use them
        • Project - counting button presses
        • Looking at synchronization in detail
