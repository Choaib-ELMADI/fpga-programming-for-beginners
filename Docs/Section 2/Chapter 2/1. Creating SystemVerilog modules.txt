1. Creating SystemVerilog Modules:
    => At the heart of every design are the modules that compose it.

    => Parameters in SystemVerilog are constants that can be defined within a module to allow for customization and reusability.
    => They enable designers to control aspects like:
        - data sizes
        - logic instantiation
        - module behavior
    => Parameters can have default values that can be overridden during module instantiation.
    => They allow the same module to be used in different configurations without modifying the module's internal code.
    => A parameter without a default value (e.g., SELECTOR) must be set during instantiation.
    => Parameters can be integers, strings, or even types.
