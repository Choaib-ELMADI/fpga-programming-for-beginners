1. Introducing Data Types:
    => In Hardware Design Languages (HDLs), like SystemVerilog, you are not just writing software but building hardware.
    => Here, you deal with physical storage like registers and wires.
    => In HDLs, you create hardware structures. The flow includes:
        - logic elements
        - lookup tables (LUTs)
        - registers
        - external memory managed by a memory controller
