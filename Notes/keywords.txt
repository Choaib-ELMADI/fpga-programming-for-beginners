==> input:
    * The "input" keyword is used to declare input ports of a module.

==> output:
    * The "output" keyword is used to declare output ports of a module.

==> wire:
    * The "wire" keyword is used to declare a signal in Verilog.
    * A wire is used for continuous assignment and to connect different parts of a circuit.
    * It represents a physical connection or a combinational logic path.

==> assign:
    * The "assign" keyword is used for continuous assignments.
    * It is used to assign values to wire data types.

==> module:
    * In Verilog, the "module" keyword is used to define a module, the basic building block of a Verilog design.

    module hello_world (
        input wire clk,       // Input clock signal port
        input wire reset,     // Input reset signal port
        output wire done      // Output done signal port
    );
        // MODULE IMPLEMENTATION HERE

    endmodule
