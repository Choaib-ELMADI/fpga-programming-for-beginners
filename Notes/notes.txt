=> Testbench modules are top-level modules. They should not have any ports.

=> In Verilog, logic variables can hold the following four-state values:
    0 ---> Logic low (false)
    1 ---> Logic high (true)
    X ---> Unknown (an indeterminate state)
    Z ---> High-impedance (tri-state, effectively disconnected)

=> In VHDL, there isn't a direct equivalent called logic. The `std_logic` type in the `std_logic_1164` library serves similar purposes.
    The `std_logic` type can represent multiple values, including:
    0 ---> Logic low
    1 ---> Logic high
    X ---> Unknown
    Z ---> High-impedance
    U ---> Uninitialized
    W ---> Weak unknown
    L ---> Weak low
    H ---> Weak high
    - ---> Don't care

=> In a testbench module, we create instances of the main modules we created.
    There are multiple ways of connecting ports:
    .* which will connect all ports with the same name.
    .<name> which uses the name of the port you wish to connect.
    .<old_name>(<new_name>) which allows port renaming.
