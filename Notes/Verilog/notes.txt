=> Testbench modules are top-level modules. They should not have any ports.

=> In Verilog, logic variables can hold the following four-state values:
    0 ---> Logic low (false)
    1 ---> Logic high (true)
    X ---> Unknown (an indeterminate state)
    Z ---> High-impedance (tri-state, effectively disconnected)

=> A testbench module is a specialized piece of code used in HDLs to verify and validate the functionality of a design under test (DUT).
-> The testbench generates a set of input signals, often referred to as stimulus, to drive the DUT. This includes all possible input scenarios that the design may encounter during actual operation.
-> If the DUT is a synchronous design, the testbench provides clock and reset signals.
-> The testbench observes the outputs of the DUT and compares them against expected values.
-> In a testbench module, we create instances of the designs under test.
