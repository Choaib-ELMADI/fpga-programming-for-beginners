1. if-then-else:
    if (add == 1) sum = a + 1;
    else if (add == 2) sum = a + 2;
    else sum = a + b;

    * The unique keyword is used to tell the synthesis tool that each if statement in a sequence will not overlap with the others.
    * This means that exactly one condition should be true, and if multiple conditions could be true, the tool will generate a warning.
    * Example:
        > unique if (address[3:0] =?= 4'b00zz) slot = 0;
        > else if (address[3:0] =?= 4'b01zz) slot = 1;
        > else if (address[3:0] =?= 4'b1zzz) slot = 2;

    * The priority keyword specifies that the first if condition that evaluates to true should be selected.
    * All other overlapping conditions that also evaluate to true should be ignored.
    * Example:
        > priority if (address[3:0] =?= 4'b00zz) slot = 0;
        > else if (address[3:0] =?= 4'b01zz) slot = 1;
        > else if (address[3:0] =?= 4'b1zzz) slot = 2;

2. Comparing values:
    == and != check if two sides of a comparison are equal or not. But they can't detect undefined values.
    === and !== are recommended to avoid unanticipated matches.
    =?= and !?= are called wildcard equality operators. They are used to match against ranges of values.
